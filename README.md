# JS-2526-adaptive-typing-challenge
An interactive typing speed test that dynamically changes difficulty based on the userâ€™s performance. If the user types too fast, sentences become longer and more complex; if they type too slow, sentences simplify. Real-time feedback, animations, and a responsive design make it a fun and unique front-end project.
